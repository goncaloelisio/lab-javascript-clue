/* Iteration 1: Create the cards
Clue has three different card types: suspects, rooms, and weapons. We'll be given the same amount of information for any given card with the same card type.

As such, let's create an array for every card type, that is going contain the objects representing each card. These arrays should be named suspectsArray, weaponsArray, roomsArray.

All of the information you need about suspects, rooms, and weapons can be found on the DATA.md file.

Suggestion: Copy this data into the clue.js file and model it into objects nested inside your cards arrays. This is a great chance for you to experiment with IDE shortcuts, multiple-line selection, find and replace, and other great features that VSCode provides you with.

Game suspects
All of six possible suspects in Clue have a first name, last name, occupation, age, description, image and color.

To complete this iteration, you should have an array that looks something like the following:

const suspectsArray = [
  {
    firstName: 'Jacob',
    lastName: 'Green',
    occupation: 'Entrepreneur'
    // ...
  }
  // ...
];
Available weapons
There are a total of nine weapons. Each of them has a different name and weight.

Mansion rooms
The game board represents the blueprints of the mansion and features fifteen different rooms. Each room will only have a name.

 /* Iteration 2: Create the mystery
 At the beginning of the game, players shuffle each of the card stacks to create a combination of suspect, weapon and room. This will be the mystery to solve.
 
 Random selector
 Declare a function named selectRandom to randomly select one element from a card stack. The function should expect an array as an argument, and should return a random element from the array.
 
 Create the mystery
 Declare a function named pickMystery that takes no arguments and returns an object with three properties, suspect, weapon and room, each holding as a value a card of that specific type. You can get a random card of each type by calling selectRandom on each card stack.
